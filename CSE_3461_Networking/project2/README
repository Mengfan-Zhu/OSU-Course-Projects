go to the project2 folder, open the terminal window and type commands to run server and client.

Sample command for server:

you may need to use "python3" instead "python" if you have both python2 & 3 in your computer.
"1500" is the port number for server, you can change it

Sample command for client:
    python ftpc.py DESKTOP-73DGQV2 1500 1600
you may need to use "python3" instead "python" if you have both python2 & 3 in your computer.
"DESKTOP-73DGQV2" is the hostname for server, you may change it according to the server you use. There is a commented
code in server.py line 11 which you can uncomment to print the server hostname
"1500" is the port number for server, it should be the same as the port number you give when run server
"1600" is the port number for client, you can change it

You can also change the _init_ function in server and client to set certain values to hostname and port number so that
you don't need to input them every time.
